# react-native-jokebook

A jokebook mobile app made with React Native.

## About

The base for this app was implemented by following [this tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/integrating-firebase-authentication-expo-mobile-app/)
on how to integrate Firebase authentication into an Expo app. This was done in school (Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences - Spring 2023)
as the final task of the mobile programming course.

### Purpose

Inspired by the fact that in this day and age, when everyone's so uptight and sensitive, laughter is a hot commodity. This app aims to provide
an avenue for a few laughs every now and again.
